# The-Ghost-In-The-Machine

The report is there named as Ghost.pdf. The google colab notebook link is in the report.

If the notebook is going to be rerun, download GloVe embeddings from:
https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

Place `glove.6B.300d.txt` in the project root.

If the notebook is going to be rerun from colab, then add the files and folders to the project root exactly as listed in this github repository.
Note that the colab notebook was made when it was connected to local runtime, hence the code could differ for different systems.
